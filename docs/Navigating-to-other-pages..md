Job Logs Page

Resmoke.py – the test runner for mongodb-mongo-* tests – has a concept of a 'job' for organizing groups of tests to run. mongodb-mongo* logs include a “Job Logs” button that allows you to view all logs within a single job.  

The Job Logs button links to the Jobs Log page on Spruce for the current test.
