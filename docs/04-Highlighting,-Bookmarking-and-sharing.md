# Highlight and Share Logs

Add Highlight can help call attention to log lines matching a specific regexp by highlighting matching terms. 

You can add multiple highlights concurrently. If you want to remove highlights, you can do so through the side panel.

Bookmarks:
You can bookmark a line by double-clicking on any part of the log line except the link icon. You can then navigate to your bookmarked lines by clicking on the corresponding line number in the bookmark pane.
The clear button at the top of the bookmark pane clears all bookmarks.

Bookmarked lines can also be copied to your local clipboard in JIRA formatting. To copy bookmarked text, click on the Jira button in the details menu. This button will copy the text content of all bookmarks of the current log file, sandwiched between {noformat} tags so they can be pasted into any JIRA ticket as monospaced text.

Sharing log lines
To share a particular log line with others, click on the link icon next to the log line. This will save the line in the URL and highlight the log line. Loading that URL will jump to the linked line.
