## Context and Problem Statement

Users often want to select and share a range of logs. Currently, Parsley only
allows selecting a single line at a time. This is not ideal for users who want
to share a range of logs. This feature introduces the ability to select multiple
lines using the shift key and displays a share menu to allow the user to share
the selected lines.
