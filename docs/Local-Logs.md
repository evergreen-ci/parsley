You can also upload local log files on Parsley.


Upon clicking the button, you will see a box to drag and drop local files. You can also select a file using  a file picker if you click the "Select from Files" button.

Once a local log file is uploaded, you can choose how to parse your logs. The options are as follows:.   
Raw: Logs do not have server-specific color coding, and will apply minimal ANSII processing. Typically choose this one if you're not looking at a resmoke log.

Resmoke: Logs have color coding to differentiate between individual config server nodes, replica set nodes, mongos, etc.  that the logs are coming from.
